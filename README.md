## How to play
Go to [diego-moreira8.github.io/odin-memory-card](https://diego-moreira8.github.io/odin-memory-card/). To win the game you must click on each character only once! The game ends when you've clicked on all of the 12 characters. If you click on a character more than once, you lose and the score resets.
